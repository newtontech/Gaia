# Gaia Documentation

## Source of Truth

The canonical specifications for Gaia live in [`foundations/`](foundations/README.md):

- [Product Scope](foundations/product-scope.md) — what Gaia is and is not
- [System Overview](foundations/system-overview.md) — architecture layers and runtime flow
- [Domain Model](foundations/domain-model.md) — nodes, hyperedges, commits, and vocabulary
- [Language Spec](foundations/language/gaia-language-spec.md) — Gaia Language semantics, package surface, and conformance rules
- [CLI Command Lifecycle](foundations/cli/command-lifecycle.md) — build / review / infer / publish pipeline
- [Theoretical Foundation](foundations/theoretical-foundation.md) — Jaynes framework, Gaia identity, plausible reasoning
- [Inference Theory](foundations/inference-theory.md) — BP algorithm, lattice theory, edge semantics

Start there for any question about current architecture, contracts, or semantics.
