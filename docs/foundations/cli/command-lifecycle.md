# Gaia CLI Command Lifecycle

> **Status: Current target semantics.** This document aligns to [`../review/publish-pipeline.md`](../review/publish-pipeline.md). The target pipeline has 3 core CLI commands (`build`, `infer`, `publish`) plus 3 agent skills (`self-review`, `graph-construction`, `rebuttal`). The shipped `gaia review` command on `main` is a compatibility bridge for the local self-review step, not part of the long-term minimal core.

## Purpose

This document defines the local-to-shared lifecycle of a Gaia package:

- deterministic package lowering
- optional local self-review and graph construction
- optional local BP preview
- publish-time peer review and registry integration

It answers one product question:

> What is the target package lifecycle from local authoring snapshot to publish-time peer review and global integration?

## Core Judgment

Gaia's target local workflow is:

```text
workspace -> build -> self-review skill -> graph-construction skill -> infer -> verify -> publish
```

In practice on `main`, the self-review step is often materialized via the shipped `gaia review` command, but the architectural boundary remains:

- CLI commands handle deterministic or mechanical data I/O
- agent skills handle judgment-heavy review and graph-construction work
- peer review, identity assignment, and global inference happen after publish

Not:

```text
workspace -> build -> run -> publish
```

## Lifecycle Stages

### Stage 0: Workspace

Before Gaia commands act on a package, the author works in a private workspace:

- read papers
- collect notes
- test hypotheses
- draft candidate claims or refs
- prepare supporting resources

This workspace is intentionally broader and messier than the published Gaia artifact.

### Stage 1: Source Package

At some point the author materializes a structured package:

- knowledge objects
- refs
- reasoning chains
- module/package boundaries
- provenance or resource links

This authored source is the input to `gaia build`.

### Stage 2: Built Package

`gaia build` is the deterministic lowering boundary.

It validates and lowers source into explicit local artifacts, including:

- `.gaia/build/` rendered module Markdown for review
- `.gaia/graph/raw_graph.json`
- `.gaia/graph/local_canonical_graph.json`
- `.gaia/graph/canonicalization_log.json`

The build result is still package-local. It does not assign global identities, search the shared graph, or add review-discovered knowledge into submitted Graph IR.

### Stage 3: Local Review And Graph Construction

After build, the agent may run two local skills:

1. **self-review**
   - assess reasoning quality
   - identify candidate weak points and unrelated refs
   - classify candidates as premise / context / irrelevant
   - write local sidecar judgments
2. **graph-construction**
   - inspect the package-owned raw graph
   - cluster package-owned propositions into a local canonical graph
   - optionally derive local parameterization for preview inference
   - require explicit source edits and rebuilds before any review-discovered knowledge becomes submitted structure

On `main`, the shipped `gaia review` command is the compatibility path that materializes local self-review output under `.gaia/reviews/`.

### Stage 4: Inferred Package

`gaia infer` is the local belief-propagation boundary.

It consumes the package's local Graph IR plus available local review sidecars, derives a local parameterization as a runtime step, and runs local BP. Typical outputs live under `.gaia/inference/`, including local parameterization artifacts and belief previews.

### Stage 5: Verified Package

> **Not yet implemented.** `gaia verify` remains a future command for execution-backed or reproducibility-backed claims.

`gaia verify` is reserved for claims whose trust depends on replay, execution, or independently checkable evidence rather than textual reasoning or BP alone.

### Stage 6: Published Package

`gaia publish` is the handoff boundary from local package lifecycle to shared package lifecycle.

After publish, the shared system may:

- run peer review against the current registry state
- search for related global knowledge
- assign `CanonicalBinding` records
- update registry-managed `GlobalInferenceState`
- merge approved package content into the global graph

That work is downstream of local CLI authority.

## Command And Skill Contracts

| Entry | Kind | Role | Determinism | Primary outputs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `build` | CLI command | deterministic package lowering | deterministic | `.gaia/build/` + `.gaia/graph/` artifacts |
| `self-review` | agent skill | local reasoning assessment | model-dependent | local review sidecars / judgments |
| `graph-construction` | agent skill | local canonicalization + optional local parameterization | mixed | local canonical graph + optional `.gaia/inference/local_parameterization.json` |
| `infer` | CLI command | local BP preview | deterministic given local artifacts | `.gaia/inference/` artifacts + belief preview |
| `verify` | CLI command | reproducibility / execution checks | execution-dependent | verification evidence sidecars |
| `publish` | CLI command | submission handoff | protocol-driven | package submission to git / registry-facing pipeline |
| `rebuttal` | agent skill | process peer review findings | model-dependent | revised package source or rebuttal artifacts |

## Current `main` Compatibility Note

The code on `main` still ships `gaia review`. Treat it as:

- a local compatibility helper for the self-review phase
- not the final architectural review boundary
- not a replacement for publish-time peer review

This distinction matters because `publish-pipeline.md` assigns peer review, canonical binding, and global probability judgments to the shared system after publish.

## Per-Command Responsibilities

### `gaia build`

Responsibilities:

- validate package structure
- resolve refs deterministically
- elaborate review-facing rendered content
- lower package source into package-local Graph IR

`build` does not perform open-world search or author-server alignment.

### `gaia infer`

Responsibilities:

- read local canonical graph artifacts
- consume locally produced review sidecars if present
- derive local parameterization from authored structure plus local review judgments
- run local belief propagation
- emit local preview beliefs

`infer` works on a package-local preview, not on the registry's global graph.

### `gaia publish`

Responsibilities:

- submit the package and its deterministic artifacts
- hand off to peer review and registry-side identity assignment
- preserve the distinction between package-local Graph IR and global registry state

## Recommended Agent Workflow

1. Author or revise package source.
2. Run `gaia build`.
3. Run self-review.
   On `main`, `gaia review` is the current compatibility path for this step.
4. If review finds a missing premise, context, or external reference that should become part of the package, update source explicitly and rebuild.
5. Run graph construction / local canonicalization.
6. Run `gaia infer` for a local belief preview if needed.
7. Run `gaia publish`.
