## 1. Purpose

This document defines the Graph IR — a canonical factor graph intermediate representation that sits between Gaia Language and belief propagation.

Gaia Language is the authored surface. Graph IR is the canonical form that machines reason about. BP runs on Graph IR, not on the language surface.

## 2. Problem

The current architecture compiles factor graphs directly from ChainExpr structures as ephemeral runtime artifacts. Storage-schema.md states: "因子图不持久存储，每次 BP 运行时从 Knowledge + Chain + ProbabilityRecord 动态构建."

This causes:

1. **No canonical identity** — the same proposition in different languages, packages, or editorial styles has no mechanism to be recognized as the same knowledge
2. **No schema/ground distinction** — universally quantified propositions and their concrete instances are not formally distinguished
3. **BP coupled to authoring surface** — two separate compilation paths (hypergraph and DSL) with no shared canonical form
4. **No auditable lowering** — the mapping from source to factor graph is implicit

## 3. Solution

Add Graph IR as an explicit layer between Gaia Language and BP.

Graph IR is a **first-class submission artifact**, submitted alongside Gaia Lang source during `gaia publish` and independently verified by the review engine.

## 4. Factor Graph Structure

Graph IR is a factor graph — a bipartite graph with two kinds of nodes connected by edges.

### 4.1 Knowledge Nodes (Factor Graph Variable Nodes)

All knowledge objects that carry belief are knowledge nodes. In factor graph theory these are called "variable nodes" — each represents a binary random variable (the proposition is true or false). In Gaia we call them **knowledge nodes** because they always correspond to knowledge objects, and to avoid confusion with the "parameters" (free placeholders) that appear in schema node content.

Knowledge nodes fall into two subcategories:

- **Standard knowledge nodes** — Claim, Setting, Question, Action
- **Relation nodes** — Contradiction, Equivalence (structural assertions about logical relationships between other knowledge objects, with their own belief)

```
KnowledgeNode:
    canonical_id:    str              # content hash: sha256(knowledge_type + content + sorted(parameters))
    knowledge_type:  str              # claim | setting | question | action |
                                      # contradiction | equivalence
    content:         str              # node content (may contain parameter placeholders like {X})
    parameters:      list[Parameter]  # empty = ground node, non-empty = schema node (∀-quantified)
    prior:           float
    belief:          float | None     # computed by BP
    source_refs:     list[SourceRef]  # traces back to Gaia Lang source objects
    metadata:        dict | None      # optional extensible metadata

Parameter:
    name:            str              # placeholder name, e.g. "A", "X"
    constraint:      str              # constraint description (includes knowledge type and semantic limits)

SourceRef:
    package:         str
    version:         str              # package semver, e.g. "1.2.0"
    module:          str
    knowledge_name:  str
```

### 4.2 Factor Nodes

Factors define constraints between knowledge nodes. They carry no belief. Each factor is self-contained: it directly references its connected knowledge nodes.

```
FactorNode:
    factor_id:              str
    type:                   str              # reasoning | instantiation |
                                             # mutex_constraint | equiv_constraint
    premises:               list[str]        # canonical_ids of premise knowledge nodes
    contexts:               list[str]        # canonical_ids of context knowledge nodes
    conclusion:             str              # canonical_id of conclusion knowledge node (singular)
    conditional_probability: float | None    # P(conclusion | all premises true)
    source_ref:             SourceRef | None
    metadata:               dict | None      # optional extensible metadata
```

**Field semantics:**

- `premises` — knowledge nodes with strong (direct) dependency. If a premise is false, the conclusion's validity is undermined. Mapped from Gaia Language `dependency: direct`.
- `contexts` — knowledge nodes with weak (indirect) dependency. Background knowledge that frames the reasoning but the conclusion can stand without it. Mapped from `dependency: indirect`. Contexts do not create BP edges; their influence is folded into `conditional_probability`.
- `conclusion` — the single knowledge node produced or controlled by this factor. For reasoning and instantiation factors, this is the reasoning conclusion that receives BP messages normally. For constraint factors (`mutex_constraint`, `equiv_constraint`), this is the Relation knowledge node acting as a read-only gate — BP reads its belief to determine constraint strength but does not send messages back to it (see [bp-on-graph-ir.md](bp-on-graph-ir.md) §4).
- `conditional_probability` — the probability that the conclusion is correct, assuming all premises are true. Corresponds to `conditional_prior` from the self-review process (see [review/publish-pipeline.md](review/publish-pipeline.md) §3).

### 4.3 Factor Types

| Factor type | Generated by | premises | contexts | conclusion | conditional_probability |
|-------------|-------------|----------|----------|------------|------------------------|
| `reasoning` | ChainExpr | direct-dep knowledge nodes | indirect-dep knowledge nodes | reasoning conclusion | P(conclusion \| premises true) |
| `instantiation` | Elaboration | `[schema node]` | `[]` | instance node | None (deterministic) |
| `mutex_constraint` | Contradiction declaration | constrained claim nodes | `[]` | Contradiction node (read-only gate) | None (use gate belief) |
| `equiv_constraint` | Equivalence declaration | equated claim nodes | `[]` | Equivalence node (read-only gate) | None (use gate belief) |

**Reasoning factor granularity:** one FactorNode per ChainExpr (not per step). A ChainExpr represents one complete reasoning unit from premises to conclusion. Intermediate steps within the chain are internal to the factor and do not appear as separate knowledge nodes. See §6.1 for the generation rule.

**Constraint factor gate:** for `mutex_constraint` and `equiv_constraint`, the `conclusion` field holds the Relation knowledge node. This node acts as a read-only gate — BP reads its belief to determine constraint strength but does not send messages back to it. The factor type determines the gate semantics. See [bp-on-graph-ir.md](bp-on-graph-ir.md) §4.

### 4.4 Factor Functions

Each factor type defines a potential function. Summary:

| Factor type | Key semantics |
|-------------|--------------|
| `reasoning` | All premises true → conclusion follows with `conditional_probability` |
| `instantiation` | Deterministic implication: schema=true → instance=true |
| `mutex_constraint` | Penalizes all contradicted claims being simultaneously true |
| `equiv_constraint` | Rewards agreement between equated claims |

For detailed factor function definitions, BP behavior, and gate semantics for Relations, see [bp-on-graph-ir.md](bp-on-graph-ir.md).

## 5. Schema and Ground Nodes

### 5.1 Definition

After `gaia build` elaboration, some knowledge objects may still contain unbound parameters (placeholders like `{X}`). These represent universally quantified propositions.

- **Schema node**: `parameters` is non-empty. Semantics: `∀x. P(x)`.
- **Ground node**: `parameters` is empty. Semantics: `P(a)`.

A partially instantiated node with k remaining unbound parameters out of n total is also a schema node — it represents `∀x₁...xₖ. P(a₁, ..., aₙ₋ₖ, x₁, ..., xₖ)`.

### 5.2 Instantiation

Instantiation is the relationship between a schema and its ground instance, produced deterministically by elaboration. It is modeled as a **factor node** (not a knowledge node) because it carries no uncertainty — if the substitution is correct, the instantiation holds.

Each instantiation factor is **binary** — it connects exactly one schema node (premise) to one instance node (conclusion):

```
V_schema ─── F_instantiation ─── V_partial
    premises:   [V_schema]
    conclusion: V_partial

V_partial ─── F_instantiation ─── V_ground
    premises:   [V_partial]
    conclusion: V_ground
```

The deductive direction (schema → instance) is modeled by `premises=[schema], conclusion=instance`. Inductive strengthening (multiple instances supporting the schema) emerges naturally from BP: each instantiation factor sends a backward message to the shared schema node, and BP aggregates these messages at the schema node.

The instantiation factor's implication semantics ensure:

- Instance belief drops → schema belief drops (counterexample weakens universal)
- Schema belief high → all instances receive support
- Multiple high-belief instances → inductive strengthening of schema (via BP message aggregation at the shared schema node)

### 5.3 All Knowledge Types Can Be Parameterized

Parameters are not limited to Actions. Any knowledge type can have parameters:

```
Schema claim:    "在{X}条件下，{Y}是混淆变量"
Ground claim:    "在落体实验条件下，空气阻力是混淆变量"

Schema setting:  "{X}环境下的{Y}实验条件"
Ground setting:  "真空环境下的落体实验条件"

Schema action:   "对{A}和{B}进行对比分析"
Ground action:   "对亚里士多德假说和真空环境进行对比分析"
```

## 6. Build: Deterministic Graph IR Generation

`gaia build` generates raw Graph IR deterministically from elaborated source. No LLM, no judgment.

### 6.1 Generation Rules

| Source construct | Knowledge node(s) generated | Factor node(s) generated |
|-----------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Claim, Setting, Question, Action | One knowledge node per elaborated object | — |
| Contradiction declaration | Contradiction knowledge node | mutex_constraint factor |
| Equivalence declaration | Equivalence knowledge node | equiv_constraint factor |
| ChainExpr | — | One reasoning factor per ChainExpr |
| Elaboration instantiation | — | One instantiation factor per schema→instance pair |

### 6.2 Build-Time Merge

Only one case merges at build time: **content hash identity**. If two elaborated knowledge objects produce byte-identical content after elaboration, they map to the same knowledge node with combined `source_refs`.

Equivalence declarations are NOT merged at build time. They become Equivalence knowledge nodes + equiv_constraint factors in the raw Graph IR. Whether to merge the equated nodes is an agent or review engine judgment.

### 6.3 Build Output

```
.gaia/graph/raw_graph.json
```

## 7. Three-Layer Canonicalization

### 7.1 Layer 1: Structural (gaia build, deterministic)

| Operation | Condition | Result |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Generate knowledge nodes | Each elaborated knowledge object | 1:1 mapping |
| Generate reasoning factors | Each ChainExpr | One factor: premises (direct deps) + contexts (indirect deps) → conclusion |
| Generate instantiation factors | Each schema→instance pair from elaboration | Binary factor: premises=[schema] → conclusion=instance |
| Generate Relation node + constraint factor | Relation declaration | Preserve as knowledge node + factor pair |
| Content hash merge | Byte-identical elaborated content | Merge nodes, combine source_refs |

### 7.2 Layer 2: Semantic (agent canonicalization skill)

The agent receives raw Graph IR and performs semantic canonicalization. The only permitted operation is **merging semantically equivalent knowledge nodes**.

What the agent does:

1. Examine knowledge nodes in the raw Graph IR
2. Identify nodes expressing the same proposition despite different content (different languages, editorial variants, synonymous phrasing)
3. Merge identified equivalent nodes: combine `source_refs`, redirect factor references to the surviving node
4. For Equivalence knowledge nodes: if confident they hold, merge the equated nodes and remove the Equivalence node + factor pair; if uncertain, leave them in the Graph IR for BP
5. Record every merge judgment in a canonicalization log

What the agent does NOT do:

- Create new nodes
- Create new factor nodes
- Modify factor graph topology beyond node merging
- Change priors or beliefs

Output:

```
.gaia/graph/canonical_graph.json
.gaia/graph/canonicalization_log.json
```

Canonicalization log records each merge with the agent's reason:

```yaml
canonicalization_log:
  - merged: [vn_007, vn_012]
    into: vn_007
    reason: "Synonymous: both express 'air resistance is the confounding variable'"
  - merged: [vn_003, vn_015]
    into: vn_003
    reason: "Same proposition in Chinese and English"
```

### 7.3 Layer 3: Global (review engine, after gaia publish)

The review engine uses the package's canonical knowledge nodes to search the global graph:

1. Embed each canonical knowledge node
2. Search existing global graph for high-similarity matches
3. Generate findings: duplicate, conflict, missing_ref, equivalence candidates
4. Agent responds via rebuttal cycle (accept → declare relationship, or rebuttal → explain difference)
5. After approval, package's canonical nodes merge into the global graph

Each layer handles only what it can reliably do, passing unresolved cases to the next.

## 8. Publish and Review

### 8.1 Submission Artifacts

`gaia publish` submits three artifacts:

1. **Gaia Lang source** — package.yaml + module YAMLs
2. **Canonicalized Graph IR** — canonical_graph.json
3. **Canonicalization log** — agent's merge decisions with reasons

### 8.2 Review Engine Verification

**Layer 1: Source ↔ Graph IR correspondence**

The review engine independently executes `gaia build` to produce its own raw Graph IR. It diffs this against the submitted canonicalized Graph IR. The only expected differences are the agent's merge operations recorded in the canonicalization log. Unexplained differences are a blocking finding.

**Layer 2: Canonicalization audit**

The review engine evaluates each merge in the canonicalization log:

- Are the merged nodes truly semantically equivalent? (blocking if wrong)
- Are there obvious equivalences the agent missed? (advisory)

**Layer 3: Global matching**

The review engine uses canonical knowledge nodes to search the global graph for duplicates, conflicts, and missing references. Findings follow the standard review → rebuttal → editor cycle per [publish-pipeline.md](review/publish-pipeline.md).

### 8.3 Verification Severity

| Check | Failure meaning | Severity |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| Source → IR rebuild mismatch | Graph IR tampered or build version mismatch | blocking |
| Unreasonable merge | Agent canonicalization error | blocking |
| Missed merge | Agent didn't discover a semantic equivalence | advisory |
| Global duplicate/conflict | Must declare relationship with existing knowledge | blocking |

## 9. BP Execution

BP runs on the canonicalized Graph IR using standard sum-product message passing on the bipartite factor graph. Cromwell's rule applies: all priors and probabilities are clamped to [ε, 1−ε] (ε = 1e-3) at Graph IR construction time.

For full details on factor functions, gate semantics for Relations, schema/ground interaction during BP, and the relationship to the existing BP implementation, see [bp-on-graph-ir.md](bp-on-graph-ir.md).

## 10. Relationship to Existing System

### 10.1 What Changes

| Component | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Factor graph status | Ephemeral runtime artifact, not persisted | First-class IR, persisted and submitted |
| BP input | Compiled from ChainExpr or from Knowledge+Chain storage | Runs on Graph IR |
| Compilation paths | Two: DSL (CompiledFactorGraph) + hypergraph (from_subgraph) | One: build → Graph IR → BP |
| Canonicalization | None | Three-layer: structural → semantic → global |
| Publish artifact | Source only | Source + Graph IR + canonicalization log |
| Review scope | Source review only | Source + IR correspondence + canonicalization audit |
| Node identity | int (FactorGraph) or name string (CompiledFactorGraph) | canonical_id with source_refs |
| Schema/ground | Not distinguished | Explicit via parameters + instantiation factors |

### 10.2 What Does NOT Change

- Gaia Lang source syntax and semantics
- Package structure (package.yaml + module YAMLs)
- CLI commands (build, infer, publish)
- Publish pipeline flow (self-review → canonicalization → publish → peer review)
- Relation type design (Contradiction, Equivalence as Knowledge root types)
- Review → rebuttal → editor cycle
- BP algorithm (sum-product with damping)
- Cromwell's rule enforcement

### 10.3 Storage Impact

Storage-schema.md currently states that factor graphs are not persisted. Under Graph IR:

- Graph IR is persisted as a package-level artifact (alongside source)
- The storage layer needs to store or reference the canonical_graph.json
- The existing `load_all_knowledge() + load_all_chains() → dynamic factor graph` path is replaced by loading the persisted Graph IR directly
- BeliefSnapshot and ProbabilityRecord continue to work as before — they reference canonical_ids instead of (knowledge_id, version) tuples

### 10.4 Compilation Path Unification

The two existing compilation paths converge:

```
Before:
  CLI:    Gaia Lang → compile_factor_graph() → CompiledFactorGraph → FactorGraph → BP
  Server: Storage → FactorGraph.from_subgraph() → FactorGraph → BP

After:
  Unified: Gaia Lang → gaia build → raw Graph IR → agent canonicalize → Graph IR → BP
           gaia publish → Graph IR stored → server BP runs on stored Graph IR
```

`FactorGraph.from_subgraph()` and `CompiledFactorGraph` become unnecessary once Graph IR is the canonical input to BP.

## 11. Open Questions

1. **Graph IR serialization format** — JSON is natural for factor graph structure; YAML for human readability. Binary formats for performance.
2. **Parameter placeholder syntax** — how to consistently represent `{X}` placeholders in content strings across packages.
3. **Factor function parameterization** — are factor functions fixed per type, or configurable per package?
4. **Graph IR schema versioning** — version marker for the IR format itself.
5. **Incremental build** — can `gaia build` incrementally update Graph IR when only some modules change?
6. **Global graph storage** — how the global graph (merged canonical nodes from all packages) is stored and indexed. Extends storage-schema.md.
