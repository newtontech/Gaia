# Gaia IR v6 Proposal: Strategy/Warrant-Aligned Minimal Redesign

> Status: design proposal  
> Date: 2026-04-20  
> Scope: canonical Gaia IR, review layer, and lowering contract  
> Design goal: align as much as possible with the current Gaia IR implementation while removing probabilistic warrant semantics.

---

## 0. Executive summary

Gaia IR v6 should **keep the current core shape**:

```text
Knowledge
Operator
Strategy
```

and add a package-level review layer:

```text
ReviewManifest / Warrant
```

The redesign is therefore not a rewrite. The main change is semantic:

```text
Old Strategy:
  probabilistic reasoning edge / strategy prior / warrant prior

New Strategy:
  reviewed information-use step that may assert generated helper claims,
  apply a likelihood score, or run/validate a computation.
```

The key v6 rules are:

1. **Only `Claim` carries epistemic probability.**
2. **`Strategy` carries no probability.**
3. **`Operator` remains deterministic and continues to have `conclusion` helper claims.**
4. **Generated helper claims are neutral unless asserted by an accepted Strategy.**
5. **The old implication “warrant helper” becomes `Strategy.assertions`.**
6. **`Warrant` moves to `ReviewManifest`; it is a review block, not a Claim and not a prior.**
7. **Statistical evidence is represented as `Strategy(type="likelihood")`, not as probabilistic support.**
8. **Raw unformalized text is represented by `Knowledge(type="context")`.**

This keeps the useful parts of the existing `Strategy / FormalStrategy / FormalExpr / Operator` framework, while removing the part that caused conceptual confusion: edge-level probability.

---

## 1. Why this redesign is needed

The current Gaia IR already has several good ingredients:

- `Claim` is the natural bearer of prior/posterior belief.
- `Operator` is deterministic and has an explicit `conclusion` helper node.
- `FormalStrategy` can embed a deterministic `FormalExpr` made of `Operator`s.
- The formalization pipeline already generates helper claims such as conjunction results, equivalence results, and implication results.

The problem is that current Strategy semantics mix several concerns:

```text
argument taxonomy      support / deduction / abduction / analogy / induction / compare
formalization shape    Strategy / CompositeStrategy / FormalStrategy
probability            strategy prior / warrant prior / conditional probability
review                 whether a step is acceptable, incomplete, or rejected
```

This becomes especially problematic for v6 because v6 wants two distinct kinds of reasoning:

```text
solid conditional reasoning:
  if the listed premises are true, the conclusion/helper assertion follows

statistical evidence:
  if the listed premises are true, apply a likelihood score to a target Claim
```

These should not both be represented as a single probabilistic `support` edge.

---

## 2. Non-goals

This proposal intentionally does **not** introduce a BP/backend object such as `Factor`, `PotentialFactor`, or `StatisticalOperator` into Gaia IR.

Gaia IR remains semantic. BP factors are a lowering target, not the IR vocabulary.

This proposal also does **not** design the final high-level relation surface API. Relation surfaces such as `equivalent(...)`, `contradicts(...)`, or `implies(...)` can be added later as Lang-level macros. The IR representation they lower into is described here, but the final user API is deferred.

---

## 3. Core object model

## 3.1 Package-level structure

```python
class GaiaPackage:
    graph: LocalCanonicalGraph
    review: ReviewManifest | None = None
```

```python
class LocalCanonicalGraph:
    knowledge: list[Knowledge]
    operators: list[Operator]
    strategies: list[Strategy]
```

The review manifest is deliberately separated from the canonical semantic graph:

```python
class ReviewManifest:
    warrants: list[Warrant]
```

This separation matters because review status can change without changing the semantic content of the graph.

---

# 4. Knowledge

## 4.1 Knowledge types

v6 should extend the existing knowledge type set to:

```python
Knowledge.type ∈ {
    "claim",
    "setting",
    "question",
    "context",
}
```

### `claim`

A proposition with truth value. This is the only Knowledge type that receives a prior/posterior and becomes a random variable during BP lowering.

### `setting`

Formalized background context, convention, or scope statement. It does not carry belief and does not become a BP variable.

### `question`

Inquiry lens or research target. It organizes exploration but is not itself a belief variable.

### `context`

Raw, not-yet-formalized text or artifact excerpt. Examples:

- paper paragraph
- experiment dashboard excerpt
- lab note
- reviewer comment source text
- LLM extraction input

A `context` item does not participate in BP. It provides traceability and raw material for later formalization.

## 4.2 Parameter values

Current Gaia parameters only distinguish name and type. v6 needs bound values so that ground parameterized claims are stable and hashable.

```python
class Parameter:
    name: str
    type: str
    value: JsonValue | None = None
```

The `value` must participate in the content hash or canonical ID of a ground parameterized Claim.

This is important for generated helper claims and statistical score claims such as:

```text
Equivalent[A, B]
Implies[G, C]
LikelihoodScore[target=H, model=two_binomial, query=theta_B>theta_A, log_lr=1.73]
```

### Knowledge references in parameters

When a parameterized Claim has a Knowledge-typed parameter (e.g., `experiment: Setting`), the parameter value stores the referenced Knowledge node's QID (qualified ID).

Example at Lang level:

```python
class ABCounts(Claim):
    """[@experiment] recorded {ctrl_k}/{ctrl_n} control conversions."""
    experiment: Setting  # Knowledge-typed parameter
    ctrl_n: int
    ctrl_k: int
    treat_n: int
    treat_k: int

exp = Setting("AB test exp_123: 50/50 randomization, March 1-14.")
counts = ABCounts(experiment=exp, ctrl_n=10000, ctrl_k=500, treat_n=10000, treat_k=550)
```

At IR level:

```python
Knowledge(
    knowledge_id="github:my_package::counts",
    type="claim",
    content="[@github:my_package::exp] recorded 500/10000 control conversions.",
    parameters=[
        Parameter(name="experiment", type="Setting", value="github:my_package::exp"),  # QID reference
        Parameter(name="ctrl_n", type="int", value=10000),
        Parameter(name="ctrl_k", type="int", value=500),
        Parameter(name="treat_n", type="int", value=10000),
        Parameter(name="treat_k", type="int", value=550),
    ],
)
```

The `[@...]` syntax in `content` is resolved at compile time to the referenced node's label or QID. This allows:

1. **Stable hashing**: Parameter values (including QID references) participate in content hash
2. **Cross-package matching**: Two packages can reference the same Setting and match on it
3. **Rendering**: `[@label]` can be rendered as Markdown links in documentation
4. **Type safety**: Lang layer enforces that Knowledge-typed parameters receive Knowledge objects

## 4.3 Grounding metadata

A root Claim may include grounding metadata explaining why its prior exists.

```python
class Grounding:
    kind: Literal[
        "assumption",
        "source_fact",
        "definition",
        "imported",
        "judgment",
        "open",
    ]
    reason: str | None = None
    source_refs: list[str] = []
    prior_rationale: str | None = None
```

Grounding is metadata; it does not affect BP directly.

Recommended lint rule:

```text
Every root Claim with a non-default prior should have grounding metadata,
or be supported by a Strategy.
```

---

# 5. Operator

## 5.1 Keep the current Operator shape

v6 should keep the existing Operator idea:

```python
class Operator:
    operator_id: str | None = None
    scope: Literal["local"] | None = None
    operator: OperatorType
    variables: list[ClaimID]
    conclusion: ClaimID
    metadata: dict | None = None
```

The important existing invariant should remain:

```text
Operator.conclusion is separate from Operator.variables.
```

That is a good design. It reifies expression results as helper Claims.

## 5.2 Operator semantics

An Operator is deterministic:

```text
Operator defines conclusion = f(variables).
```

Examples:

```text
G = Conjunction(A, B, C)
R = Equivalence(A, B)
K = Contradiction(A, B)
S = Implication(G, C)
```

The crucial v6 change:

```text
Operator.conclusion is not automatically asserted true.
```

It is simply an expression-result helper Claim.

## 5.3 Helper claim default

All generated Operator helper Claims should default to neutral unless explicitly asserted:

```text
default prior/helper treatment = neutral
```

They must not be automatically pinned to `true` merely because they are relation helper claims.

This is the main change needed to prevent accidental unconditional relation assertions such as:

```text
Equivalent(A, B) automatically binds A and B.
```

In v6, `Equivalent(A, B)` creates the helper:

```text
R = same_truth(A, B)
```

but `R` matters only when some accepted Strategy asserts a helper that entails or uses `R`.

## 5.4 Helper metadata

Generated helpers should be tagged for traceability:

```python
metadata={
    "generated": True,
    "generated_kind": "helper_claim",
    "helper_kind": "implication_result" | "conjunction_result" | "equivalence_result" | ...,
    "visibility": "formal_internal" | "public",
    "owning_strategy_id": "...",
}
```

The exact existing helper naming mechanism can be preserved.

---

# 6. Strategy

## 6.1 Revised Strategy contract

v6 keeps the name `Strategy`, but changes its contract.

Old contract:

```text
Strategy is an uncertain reasoning declaration.
Premises support conclusion with some probability.
```

New contract:

```text
Strategy is a reviewed information-use step.
It has inputs, a conclusion/target, a method, generated helper assertions,
and a first-class reason.

Strategy carries no probability parameter.
```

A Strategy answers:

```text
What information is being used?
By what method?
For what target?
What helper claims are asserted when review permits?
Why is this step valid?
```

## 6.2 Strategy schema

The current Strategy class can be extended rather than replaced.

```python
class Strategy:
    strategy_id: str | None = None
    scope: Literal["local"]

    type: StrategyType

    premises: list[ClaimID]
    conclusion: ClaimID | None = None
    background: list[KnowledgeID] | None = None

    reason: str                         # v6: first-class, not metadata
    assertions: list[ClaimID] = []        # v6: generated helper claims to assert

    steps: list[Step] | None = None
    metadata: dict[str, Any] | None = None
```

`reason` is required for reviewable v6 Strategies.

`assertions` is explicit. It replaces the implicit old assumption that a generated “warrant helper” and its prior determine support strength.

## 6.3 FormalStrategy remains useful

`FormalStrategy` should remain the canonical way to attach deterministic Operator expansion to a Strategy.

```python
class FormalStrategy(Strategy):
    formal_expr: FormalExpr
```

`FormalExpr` remains:

```python
class FormalExpr:
    operators: list[Operator]
```

v6 interpretation:

```text
FormalExpr creates helper Claims via deterministic Operators.
Strategy.assertions lists which of those helper Claims are asserted when review permits.
```

## 6.4 Strategy types

The v6 core should collapse Strategy types into a small set of lowering methods:

```python
class StrategyType(StrEnum):
    DEDUCTION = "deduction"
    LIKELIHOOD = "likelihood"
    COMPUTE = "compute"
    OPAQUE_CONDITIONAL = "opaque_conditional"  # legacy / escape hatch
```

Legacy or authoring-only taxonomy should move to metadata:

```text
support
prediction
observation
citation
explanation
abduction
induction
analogy
compare
```

Recommended metadata:

```python
metadata={
    "surface_construct": "supported_by",
    "pattern": "citation" | "derivation" | "prediction" | "observation" | ...,
}
```

## 6.5 Why `deduction` is the canonical name

In v6, ordinary “support” is only valid after all defeasibility has been turned into explicit premises.

Thus canonical IR support is:

```text
AllTrue(premises) => conclusion
```

This is deduction in the Gaia IR sense:

```text
If the listed premises are true, the conclusion/helper assertion is licensed.
```

This does **not** mean the premises are certain. The premises may be probabilistic Claims. It only means the Strategy itself is solid under those premises.

---

# 7. Strategy.assertions and the old warrant helper

## 7.1 Mapping to the current warrant helper

Current Gaia formalization already generates implication helper Claims for support/deduction-like strategies, for example:

```text
G = AllTrue(A, B)
S = Implies(G, C)
```

The old design often called `S` a warrant helper and attached a prior to it.

v6 keeps `S`, but changes its meaning:

```text
S is an assertion helper.
It is generated by Operator.
It is listed in Strategy.assertions.
It carries no warrant prior.
```

So:

```python
Strategy.assertions = [S]
```

means:

```text
When this Strategy is accepted by review policy, assert S.
```

## 7.2 Why keep explicit assertions?

Explicit `assertions` are useful because they answer:

```text
Which generated helper Claims does this Strategy license?
```

They also make lowering and review deterministic.

Without `assertions`, lowering would need to guess which helper in `FormalExpr` is the intended assertion. That is fragile for relation, compare, compute, and future multi-step strategies.

---

# 8. Deduction Strategy

## 8.1 Basic deduction

For a user-level support step:

```text
A, B, rule_applies support C
```

canonical formalization creates:

```text
G = AllTrue(A, B, rule_applies)
S = Implies(G, C)
```

IR sketch:

```python
FormalStrategy(
    type="deduction",
    premises=[A, B, rule_applies],
    conclusion=C,
    reason="Given A, B, and the applicable rule, C follows.",
    assertions=[S],
    formal_expr=FormalExpr(operators=[
        Operator("conjunction", [A, B, rule_applies], conclusion=G),
        Operator("implication", [G, C], conclusion=S),
    ]),
)
```

Review policy decides whether `S` is asserted.

## 8.2 Gated relation via deduction

A gated relation such as:

```text
Given mapping_valid and units_consistent, A and B are equivalent.
```

should canonicalize to:

```text
G = AllTrue(mapping_valid, units_consistent)
R = Equivalent(A, B)
S = Implies(G, R)
```

The Strategy asserts `S`, not `R`.

This preserves gated relation semantics:

```text
If the gate premises are likely true, the relation has force.
If the gate premises are unlikely, the relation contributes little.
```

No sampling or thresholding is required. BP marginalizes over the gate Claim(s).

## 8.3 Empty premises

A deduction Strategy with empty premises is an unconditional assertion.

This should be allowed only for:

- definitions
- axioms
- compiler-generated internals
- reviewed package-level declarations

Recommended lint:

```text
Warn on author-facing deduction with empty premises unless marked as definition/axiom/internal.
```

---

# 9. Likelihood Strategy

## 9.1 Purpose

`Strategy(type="likelihood")` represents Jaynes/Bayes-style evidence update:

```text
Given premises, apply a likelihood score to target Claim(s).
```

It is not deduction.

AB tests, Mendel ratios, measurement models, Bayes factors, and model comparisons belong here.

## 9.2 Standard library and auto-generated assumptions

At the Lang level, Gaia v6 provides a standard library of parameterized Claim classes for common statistical assumptions:

```python
RandomAssignment(experiment: Setting)
ConsistentLogging(experiment: Setting)
NoEarlyStopping(experiment: Setting)
FormulaCorrect(formula_name: str)
ImplementationCorrect(formula_name: str)
```

Standard helpers like `ab_test(counts, target)` auto-generate these assumption Claims with default priors, so users don't manually declare them unless overriding.

At IR level, these appear as ordinary `Knowledge(type="claim")` nodes with bound parameters. The IR doesn't distinguish "standard library Claims" from user Claims — they're all just parameterized Claims with priors.

## 9.3 Schema extension

A likelihood Strategy should have a method payload:

```python
class LikelihoodMethod:
    score: ClaimID | ArtifactRef
    score_type: Literal["log_lr", "bayes_factor", "likelihood_table", "custom"]
    model: str | dict
    query: str | dict
```

Example:

```python
Strategy(
    type="likelihood",
    premises=[
        ab_counts_true,
        randomization_valid,
        logging_valid,
        stopping_rule_accounted_for,
        ab_log_lr_score_correct,
    ],
    conclusion=B_better,
    reason=(
        "Given valid experiment assumptions and a correctly computed likelihood "
        "score, the AB-test likelihood ratio updates belief in whether B improves conversion."
    ),
    method=LikelihoodMethod(
        score=ab_log_lr_score,
        score_type="log_lr",
        model="two_binomial",
        query="theta_B > theta_A",
    ),
    assertions=[],
)
```

## 9.3 Semantics

If the Strategy is included by review policy:

```text
if all premises are true:
    apply likelihood score to conclusion/target
else:
    neutral
```

For binary target `H` and log-likelihood ratio `s`:

```text
if premises true:
    odds(H) *= exp(s)
else:
    no update
```

The Strategy itself has no probability. The score is model/data-derived evidence strength; the premises carry epistemic reliability.

---

# 10. Compute Strategy

## 10.1 Purpose

`Strategy(type="compute")` represents execution or validation of a deterministic computation that produces a parameterized Claim or artifact.

Example use cases:

- compute a p-value
- compute a likelihood ratio
- compute an observed rate
- compute a model prediction

## 10.2 Schema extension

```python
class ComputeMethod:
    function_ref: str
    input_bindings: dict[str, ClaimID]
    output: ClaimID | ArtifactRef
    output_binding: dict[str, str] | None = None
    code_hash: str | None = None
```

Example:

```python
Strategy(
    type="compute",
    premises=[ab_counts_true, two_binomial_formula_correct, implementation_correct],
    conclusion=ab_log_lr_score_correct,
    reason="Compute the AB-test log likelihood ratio from the observed counts.",
    method=ComputeMethod(
        function_ref="two_binomial_log_lr",
        input_bindings={"counts": ab_counts_true},
        output=ab_log_lr_score,
        output_binding={"log_lr": "return_value"},
    ),
)
```

A compute Strategy can itself be reviewed. If computation validity is uncertain, add explicit premise Claims such as:

```text
formula_correct
implementation_correct
input_binding_correct
constants_correct
```

Do not add a compute prior.

---

# 11. Opaque conditional Strategy

`Strategy(type="opaque_conditional")` is a legacy escape hatch for old-style CPT reasoning.

It may reference a parameterization record such as:

```python
OpaqueConditionalMethod(parameter_ref="cond_001")
```

It should not be the preferred v6 path.

Recommended lint:

```text
Opaque conditional strategy found.
Prefer explicit premise Claims + deduction, or likelihood strategy for statistical evidence.
```

---

# 12. ReviewManifest and Warrant

## 12.1 Warrant is not Knowledge

A v6 Warrant is not a Claim and does not enter BP.

It is a review block attached to a Strategy:

```python
class Warrant:
    id: str
    subject_strategy_id: StrategyID
    subject_hash: str

    status: Literal[
        "unreviewed",
        "accepted",
        "rejected",
        "needs_inputs",
        "superseded",
    ]

    blocking: bool = True
    review_question: str | None = None
    required_inputs: list[ClaimID] = []
    reviewer_notes: list[ReviewNote] = []
    resolution: str | None = None
```

## 12.2 Subject hash

A Warrant should be tied to the hash of the Strategy it reviewed.

Suggested hash payload:

```text
strategy.type
strategy.premises
strategy.conclusion
strategy.reason
strategy.assertions
strategy.method payload
strategy.formal_expr canonical hash
```

If the Strategy changes, the old Warrant should become `superseded` or invalid.

## 12.3 Review policy

Strict mode:

```text
accepted       -> include Strategy
unreviewed     -> exclude / error
needs_inputs   -> exclude
rejected        -> exclude
superseded      -> exclude
```

Draft mode:

```text
accepted       -> include
unreviewed     -> include with warning
needs_inputs   -> exclude or include with strong warning, configurable
rejected        -> exclude
superseded      -> exclude
```

Audit mode:

```text
No BP lowering required; produce review report.
```

## 12.4 Warrant vs assertion helper

v6 intentionally separates:

```text
assertion helper:
  generated Claim such as S = Implies(G, C)
  lives in Knowledge
  may be listed in Strategy.assertions

review Warrant:
  ReviewManifest object
  status controls whether Strategy may assert helpers
  no prior/posterior
```

The old “warrant prior” should be removed.

---

# 13. Parameterization

## 13.1 Claim priors

The only normal epistemic priors are Claim priors:

```python
ClaimPriorRecord(
    claim_id="randomization_valid",
    prior=0.98,
    rationale="Experiment platform used hash randomization and no SRM was detected.",
)
```

## 13.2 No warrant priors

v6 should not have:

```text
WARRANT_PRIORS
Strategy priors
support priors
relation priors
compute priors
```

If something is uncertain, it should become a premise Claim.

## 13.3 Likelihood scores

Likelihood Strategy needs scores. These scores may live in:

1. a parameterized Claim, such as `LikelihoodScore(log_lr=1.73)`, or
2. a parameterization record, such as `LikelihoodScoreRecord`.

Recommended first-class parameterization:

```python
class LikelihoodScoreRecord:
    score_id: str
    strategy_id: StrategyID
    score_type: Literal["log_lr", "bayes_factor", "likelihood_table", "custom"]
    value: JsonValue | ArtifactRef
    rationale: str | None = None
```

This is not a Strategy prior. It is model/data evidence strength.

---

# 14. BP lowering contract

## 14.1 Claim variables

Every `Knowledge(type="claim")` becomes a Boolean random variable.

```text
X_C ∈ {false, true}
```

Claim priors come from parameterization or defaults.

## 14.2 Operators

Operators lower to deterministic constraints defining their helper conclusion.

```text
helper = f(variables)
```

Operator conclusions are not asserted true by default.

## 14.3 Deduction Strategy

For an included deduction Strategy:

```text
assert each helper in Strategy.assertions
```

Usually:

```text
G = AllTrue(premises)
S = Implies(G, conclusion)
assert S
```

Hard semantics:

```text
forbid S=false
```

Implementation may use an epsilon relaxation for numerical stability, but this is not an IR-level probability.

## 14.4 Likelihood Strategy

For an included likelihood Strategy:

```text
if premises all true:
    apply likelihood score to target/conclusion
else:
    neutral
```

BP can implement this as a gated likelihood factor or equivalent lowering. This is a backend detail and does not introduce `Factor` to Gaia IR.

## 14.5 Compute Strategy

Compute Strategy either:

1. materializes output Claims/artifacts before BP, or
2. validates that output Claims correspond to inputs and function references.

Any uncertainty about formulas, code, constants, or bindings must be explicit in premises.

---

# 15. Migration from current IR

## 15.1 Keep

Keep:

- `Knowledge`
- `Operator`
- `Operator.conclusion`
- generated helper claims
- `Strategy`
- `FormalStrategy`
- `FormalExpr`
- `CompositeStrategy` as a grouping/view/legacy construct

## 15.2 Add

Add:

- `Knowledge(type="context")`
- `Parameter.value`
- `Strategy.reason`
- `Strategy.assertions`
- `Strategy(type="likelihood")`
- `Strategy(type="compute")`
- `ReviewManifest`
- `Warrant`
- likelihood score parameterization

## 15.3 Deprecate or reinterpret

Deprecate as core v6 semantics:

- `StrategyType.INFER`
- `StrategyType.NOISY_AND`
- `StrategyType.SUPPORT` as soft warrant support
- warrant prior
- Strategy prior
- relation helper auto-assert

Reinterpret:

```text
current generated implication warrant helper
  -> v6 assertion helper listed in Strategy.assertions

current Warrant-as-probability
  -> removed

human review warrant
  -> ReviewManifest.Warrant
```

## 15.4 Lowering changes

Required changes:

1. Do not propagate `metadata.prior` into support/deduction helper claims in v6 mode.
2. Do not auto-pin relation Operator conclusions to true.
3. Assert helper claims only if they appear in an included Strategy's `assertions`.
4. Gate inclusion by ReviewManifest in strict/reviewed modes.
5. Add likelihood strategy lowering.

---

# 16. Examples

## 16.1 Source report deduction

Domain:

```text
A paper reports X.
The extracted statement is correct.
The source is reliable for this claim.
Therefore X.
```

Claims:

```text
paper_reports_X
extraction_correct
source_reliable_for_X
X
```

Generated helpers:

```text
G = AllTrue(paper_reports_X, extraction_correct, source_reliable_for_X)
S = Implies(G, X)
```

Strategy:

```python
Strategy(
    type="deduction",
    premises=[paper_reports_X, extraction_correct, source_reliable_for_X],
    conclusion=X,
    reason="A correct extraction from a reliable source report establishes X.",
    assertions=[S],
)
```

## 16.2 Gated equivalence relation

Domain:

```text
Given ratio_mapping_valid, the claim '3:1 dominant:recessive ratio'
is equivalent to 'dominant phenotype probability is 0.75'.
```

Generated helpers:

```text
G = AllTrue(ratio_mapping_valid)
R = Equivalent(ratio_3_to_1, p_equals_075)
S = Implies(G, R)
```

Strategy asserts `S`.

This means the equivalence has force only to the extent that `ratio_mapping_valid` is credible.

## 16.3 AB test likelihood

Claims (instances of parameterized Claim classes):

```text
B_better                          — target hypothesis Claim
ab_counts_true                    — ABCounts(experiment=exp, ctrl_n=10000, ctrl_k=500, treat_n=10000, treat_k=550)
randomization_valid               — RandomAssignment(experiment=exp)
logging_valid                     — ConsistentLogging(experiment=exp)

Note: `experiment=exp` means these Claims reference a `Setting` node via Knowledge parameter. At IR level, this is stored as a QID reference in the `Parameter.value` field.

Compute Strategy:

```python
Strategy(
    type="compute",
    premises=[ab_counts_true, formula_correct, implementation_correct],
    conclusion=ab_log_lr_score_correct,
    reason="Compute the two-binomial log likelihood ratio from AB counts.",
    method=ComputeMethod(
        function_ref="two_binomial_log_lr",
        input_bindings={"counts": ab_counts_true},
        output=ab_log_lr_score_correct,
        output_binding={"log_lr": "return_value"},
    ),
)
```

Likelihood Strategy:

```python
Strategy(
    type="likelihood",
    premises=[
        ab_counts_true,
        randomization_valid,
        logging_valid,
        stopping_rule_accounted_for,
        ab_log_lr_score_correct,
    ],
    conclusion=B_better,
    reason="Apply the computed AB likelihood score to B_better under valid experiment assumptions.",
    method=LikelihoodMethod(
        score=ab_log_lr_score,
        score_type="log_lr",
        model="two_binomial",
        query="theta_B > theta_A",
    ),
)
```

In practice, the Lang layer provides `ab_test(counts, target)` helpers that auto-generate these standard assumption Claims, so users don't manually declare them unless overriding defaults.

# 17. Open questions

1. Should `Strategy.assertions` be required for every `Strategy(type="deduction")`?
   - Recommended: yes, after formalization.

2. Should `StrategyType.SUPPORT` be kept as a legacy alias?
   - Recommended: yes for migration, but canonical v6 should emit `deduction`.

3. Should likelihood scores be stored primarily as Claims or parameterization records?
   - Recommended: support both; prefer parameterized Claim when the score itself should be inspectable or reusable.

4. Should `CompositeStrategy` remain core or become a view/grouping object?
   - Recommended: keep for compatibility, but do not rely on it for core semantics.

5. Should review status live in the graph file or separate manifest?
   - Recommended: separate `ReviewManifest`, distributed with package.

# 18. Final contract

Gaia IR v6 should be summarized as:

```text
Knowledge:
  What claims, settings, questions, and raw contexts exist?

Operator:
  What deterministic helper expressions are defined?

Strategy:
  Which reviewed information-use steps assert helpers, apply likelihoods,
  or validate computations?

ReviewManifest/Warrant:
  Which Strategies are accepted, rejected, unreviewed, or need more inputs?
```

The important conceptual correction is:

```text
Strategy is not a probability edge.
Warrant is not a probability variable.
Generated helper claims are not automatically true.
```

Instead:

```text
Claim carries uncertainty.
Strategy carries solid reasoning structure.
Likelihood carries statistical evidence strength.
Warrant carries review status.
```
