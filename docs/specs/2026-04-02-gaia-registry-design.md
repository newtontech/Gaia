# Gaia Official Registry - Phase 1 Design

> **Status:** Target design
>
> **Depends on:** [Gaia Lang v5](2026-04-02-gaia-lang-v5-python-dsl-design.md), [Gaia IR v2](../foundations/gaia-ir/02-gaia-ir.md), [Ecosystem](../foundations/ecosystem/)
>
> **Phase 1 scope:** Package registration + CI validation for GitHub-backed source releases. Review system deferred. Distribution/install infrastructure deferred.

## 1. Overview

The Gaia Official Registry is a metadata-only GitHub repository. In Phase 1 it behaves like a **source registry**, not an installable package index.

What the registry records:
- package identity: `uuid`, `name`
- source location: GitHub repository URL
- version identity: semantic version, git tag, pinned git SHA
- content identity: `ir_hash`
- dependency metadata: Gaia package dependencies declared in `pyproject.toml`

What the registry does **not** do in Phase 1:
- host wheels
- publish a PEP 503 `simple/` index
- guarantee `uv add <package-name>` by package name alone

### 1.1 Architecture

```

### 1.2 Key Properties

| Property | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| Source of truth | Author's GitHub repo + pushed git tag |
| Registry role | Index + validation metadata only |
| Trust chain | Registry CI recompiles and validates source by pinned SHA |
| Decentralized authoring | Registry stores metadata, not package source |
| Zero extra infrastructure | GitHub repo + GitHub Actions |
| Auditable | Every registration is a git commit and CI run |
| Future-compatible | New source kinds can be added later without changing the package model |

> **Phase 1 deviation from ecosystem foundation:** The ecosystem doc (`04-registry-operations.md`) states that review is a precondition for registry entry. Phase 1 intentionally relaxes this to bootstrap the package graph. Structural integrity is verified, but no epistemic review gate is enforced yet.

## 2. Registry Repo Structure

```
gaia-registry/
├── packages/
│   ├── galileo-falling-bodies/
│   │   ├── Package.toml
│   │   ├── Versions.toml
│   │   └── Deps.toml
│   └── ...
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── register.yml
├── scripts/
│   └── ...
├── registry.toml
└── README.md
```

### 2.1 Package Metadata

**Package.toml** - one per package, created at first registration:

```toml
uuid = "336ed68f-0bac-5ca0-87d4-7b16caf5d00b"
name = "galileo-falling-bodies"
pypi_name = "galileo-falling-bodies-gaia"
repo = "https://github.com/kunyuan/GalileoFallingBodies.gaia"
description = "Galileo's falling bodies argument"
created_at = "2026-04-02T10:00:00Z"
```

`pypi_name` is retained as the canonical package distribution name, even though Phase 1 does not yet expose a wheel index.

**Versions.toml** - appended with each new version:

```toml
[versions."4.0.0"]
ir_hash = "sha256:a1b2c3d4..."
git_tag = "v4.0.0"
git_sha = "abc123def456..."
registered_at = "2026-04-02T10:30:00Z"

[versions."4.1.0"]
ir_hash = "sha256:e5f6g7h8..."
git_tag = "v4.1.0"
git_sha = "789abc012def..."
registered_at = "2026-04-10T15:00:00Z"
```

Notes:
- `ir_hash` uses the same `sha256:...` form emitted by `gaia compile`
- `git_sha` is the immutable source pin used by consumers and future automation
- no wheel metadata appears in Phase 1

**Deps.toml** - Gaia package dependencies per version:

```toml
[deps."4.0.0"]
"aristotle-mechanics-gaia" = ">= 1.0.0"

[deps."4.1.0"]
"aristotle-mechanics-gaia" = ">= 1.0.0"
"newton-mechanics-gaia" = ">= 2.0.0"
```

`Deps.toml` is derived from `pyproject.toml` by filtering to `*-gaia` dependencies only. `gaia register` generates it automatically. Registry CI verifies consistency.

### 2.2 Global Config

```toml
[registry]
name = "Gaia Official Registry"
repo = "https://github.com/SiliconEinstein/gaia-registry"
kind = "source-registry"
default_source_kind = "github"

[policy]
new_package_wait_hours = 72
version_update_wait_hours = 1
require_review = false
min_review_count = 0
```

## 3. Registration Flow

### 3.1 Author Workflow

```bash
cd ~/my-package
# ... edit package source ...
gaia compile .
gaia check .
git add . && git commit -m "Prepare v1.0.0"
git push origin main
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
gaia register
```

Phase 1 only accepts a release if:
1. source is already pushed to GitHub
2. the registration tag exists
3. the tag is pushed
4. the tag resolves to the exact commit being registered

### 3.2 `gaia register`

`gaia register` automates PR creation:

1. read `pyproject.toml` for package metadata (`[project]` + `[tool.gaia].uuid`)
2. read `.gaia/ir_hash`
3. verify the git worktree is clean
4. verify the registration tag exists, points to `HEAD`, and is pushed
5. infer the GitHub repo URL from `origin` unless explicitly overridden
6. write or update `Package.toml`, `Versions.toml`, and `Deps.toml`
7. prepare a registry PR

Phase 1 source support is intentionally narrow: the release being registered must come from a **GitHub repository + pushed git tag**. Future phases may add other source kinds, such as PyPI sdists.

### 3.3 Registration PR Payload

PR body example:

```markdown
## Register: galileo-falling-bodies-gaia v4.0.0

- Repository: https://github.com/kunyuan/GalileoFallingBodies.gaia
- Tag: v4.0.0
- IR Hash: sha256:a1b2c3d4...

### Exported claims
- `vacuum_prediction` - In a vacuum, objects of different mass fall at the same rate.
- `air_resistance` - Observed speed differences are caused by air resistance.

### Dependencies
- aristotle-mechanics-gaia >= 1.0.0
```

## 4. CI Validation (`register.yml`)

Phase 1 uses two jobs:
- an **untrusted sandbox** that executes author code
- a **trusted gate** that only reads metadata and validation results

This split exists because `gaia compile` imports author Python code.

### 4.1 Sandbox Validation

The sandbox job:
1. parses the proposed registry metadata
2. clones the package repo
3. checks out the declared git tag or pinned git SHA
4. resolves the actual `git_sha`
5. installs the Gaia CLI/runtime needed for compilation
6. runs `gaia compile .`
7. compares the resulting `.gaia/ir_hash` with the declared registry `ir_hash`
8. runs `gaia check .`
9. **validates `namespace`** — each registry enforces that the package's namespace matches the registry identity (e.g., the GitHub Official Registry requires `namespace == "github"`). This ensures that the namespace in published QIDs is trustworthy and reflects the actual source registry. The local CLI does not enforce namespace values, so this is the authoritative validation point.
10. verifies all Gaia dependencies in `pyproject.toml` are already registered

### 4.2 Trusted Gate

The trusted job does not execute author code. It:
- verifies UUID uniqueness for new packages
- verifies package ownership or authorization policy
- records the validated `git_sha` into `Versions.toml` if needed
- labels the PR and applies waiting-period policy

### 4.3 Waiting Policy

| Scenario | Waiting period | Rationale |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| New package | 72 hours | Community review window |
| Version update | 1 hour | Lower operational risk |

## 5. Consumer Workflow

Phase 1 consumers use the registry as a **source discovery layer**.

The registry answers:
- what the package is called
- which GitHub repo is canonical
- which tag and git SHA correspond to a version
- which Gaia dependencies that version declares

### 5.1 Installing or Pinning a Registered Package

Consumers can install directly from the pinned source:

```bash
uv add "galileo-falling-bodies-gaia @ git+https://github.com/kunyuan/GalileoFallingBodies.gaia@b8c88fdf7b06a17559941a2741472b5b50af3e20"
```

That is less convenient than `uv add galileo-falling-bodies-gaia`, but it preserves the correct trust model while Phase 1 remains source-only.

### 5.2 Future UX Layer

Phase 1 does not require it, but Gaia may later add a convenience command such as:

```bash
gaia add galileo-falling-bodies
```

Internally, that command would resolve the package through registry metadata and then write the correct GitHub direct reference into `pyproject.toml`.

## 6. Trust Model

### 6.1 Guarantees

Phase 1 guarantees:
- every registered version points to a concrete GitHub repo and immutable git SHA
- registry CI can recompile the source and verify the declared `ir_hash`
- author code never executes in a job with registry write permissions
- registry metadata remains auditable and forkable

### 6.2 What Phase 1 Does Not Guarantee

| Not guaranteed | Why | Future phase |
|---|---|---|
| Scientific quality | No review gate yet | Phase 2 |
| Probability values verified | No parameterization review | Phase 2 |
| Name-only installs via `uv add` | No wheel/index distribution | Later installable registry phase |
| PyPI-backed source support | GitHub is the only source kind | Later multi-source phase |

### 6.3 Limitations

- public GitHub repos only
- no review-based admission yet
- no distribution artifacts or GitHub Pages package index yet
- package consumers may need explicit Git direct references until a Gaia UX wrapper exists

## 7. CLI Surface

```bash
# Author-side
gaia compile
gaia check
gaia register

# Registry-side
register.yml   # validate PRs against source repo + tag + ir_hash
```

No author-side `gaia publish` exists in Phase 1.

## 8. Phase 2+ Extension Points

### 8.1 Review Gate

Later phases can require:
- reviewer assignment
- signed review reports
- parameterization validation

### 8.2 Additional Source Kinds

The registry object model is intentionally source-descriptor based. After GitHub-only Phase 1, new handlers can be added:
- `github`
- `pypi-sdist`
- other audited source providers

### 8.3 Installable Registry

A later phase may add:
- wheel builds
- GitHub Releases
- `simple/` index generation
- package-name installs via `uv add`

Those capabilities are explicitly out of scope for Phase 1.

## 9. Example End-to-End

```bash
# Author side
uv init --lib my-research-gaia
uv add gaia-lang
uv add "galileo-falling-bodies-gaia @ git+https://github.com/kunyuan/GalileoFallingBodies.gaia@v4.0.1"

gaia compile .
gaia check .
git add . && git commit -m "Initial release"
git push origin main
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
gaia register

# Registry CI
# 1. Clone package repo
# 2. Checkout tag / pin git_sha
# 3. gaia compile . and compare ir_hash
# 4. gaia check .
# 5. Verify Gaia deps are already registered
# 6. Approve / merge after policy wait

# Consumer side
uv add "my-research-gaia @ git+https://github.com/author/MyResearch.gaia@<validated-git-sha>"
```
