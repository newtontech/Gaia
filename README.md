A Python DSL for authoring machine-readable scientific knowledge. Gaia Lang lets researchers declare propositions, logical constraints, and reasoning strategies as Python objects, then compiles them into a canonical intermediate representation (Gaia IR) for inference via belief propagation.

## Quick Example

Galileo's thought experiment: tie a heavy stone 🪨 to a light stone 🪶. Does the composite fall faster or slower?

```python
from gaia.lang import claim, contradiction, deduction, abduction

# 📋 The observation everyone agrees on
obs_daily = claim("Heavy objects fall faster than light ones in air.")

# 🏛️ Two competing explanations
aristotle = claim("🏛️ Speed is proportional to weight — heavier = faster.")
air_resistance = claim("🌬️ The speed difference is caused by air resistance, not weight.")

# 🔍 Abduction: which explanation better accounts for the observation?
abduction(observation=obs_daily, hypothesis=air_resistance, alternative=aristotle,
    reason="Both explain why heavy objects fall faster in air.")

# 🤔 Meanwhile, Aristotle's doctrine implies contradictory predictions
composite_slower = claim("🪨🪶 The composite falls SLOWER than the heavy stone alone.")
composite_faster = claim("🪨🪶 The composite falls FASTER than either stone alone.")
deduction(premises=[aristotle], conclusion=composite_slower,
    reason="If heavier = faster, the light stone drags the heavy one back.")
deduction(premises=[aristotle], conclusion=composite_faster,
    reason="If heavier = faster, the heavier composite must fall faster.")

# ⚔️ Same premise, opposite conclusions — that's a contradiction!
paradox = contradiction(composite_slower, composite_faster,
    reason="Aristotle's own logic predicts both faster AND slower")

# 💡 Remove the air, remove the difference
vacuum_law = claim("💡 In vacuum, all bodies fall at the same rate.")
deduction(premises=[air_resistance], conclusion=vacuum_law,
    reason="If air resistance is the sole cause, removing it means all fall equally.")
```

`gaia compile . && gaia infer .` compiles this into a factor graph and runs belief propagation:

| Claim | Prior | → | Belief | |
|-------|------:|---|-------:|---|
| 📋 Daily observation | 0.90 | → | **1.00** | 📈 confirmed by both explanations |
| 🏛️ Aristotle's law | 0.90 | → | **0.07** | 📉 contradiction propagates back — refuted |
| 🌬️ Air resistance | 0.50 | → | **0.94** | 📈 abduction: the better explanation wins |
| 🪨🪶 Composite slower | 0.60 | → | **0.40** | 📉 contradiction forces mutual exclusion |
| 🪨🪶 Composite faster | 0.60 | → | **0.40** | 📉 symmetric with composite slower |
| 💡 Vacuum law | 0.30 | → | **0.96** | 📈 Galileo wins — remove air, all fall equally |

Note how the contradiction and abduction are independent subgraphs, yet BP automatically combines both lines of evidence: the contradiction refutes Aristotle (0.90 → 0.07) while the abduction elevates air resistance (0.50 → 0.94), and together they lift the vacuum law from a speculative 0.30 to a near-certain **0.96** — no new experimental data needed, just the structure of the reasoning itself.

## Create a Knowledge Package

**1. Initialize**

```bash
gaia init galileo-falling-bodies-gaia
cd galileo-falling-bodies-gaia
```

This scaffolds a complete package with `pyproject.toml` (including `[tool.gaia]`
config and a generated UUID), the correct `src/` directory layout, and a DSL
template. Package name must end with `-gaia`.

**2. Write DSL declarations**

Organize your knowledge in separate modules under the package directory. `gaia compile` imports the top-level package, so any file transitively imported from `__init__.py` is automatically discovered.

`src/galileo_falling_bodies/knowledge.py` — declare propositions:

```python
from gaia.lang import claim

aristotle = claim("Aristotle's doctrine: the heavier an object is, the faster it falls.")
heavy_faster = claim("A heavy stone falls faster than a light one in air.")
composite_slower = claim("The composite should fall slower — the light stone drags the heavy one back.")
composite_faster = claim("The composite should fall faster — the combined weight is greater.")
vacuum_law = claim("In vacuum all bodies fall at the same rate.")
```

`src/galileo_falling_bodies/reasoning.py` — declare constraints and strategies:

```python
from gaia.lang import contradiction, deduction
from .knowledge import aristotle, composite_slower, composite_faster, heavy_faster, vacuum_law

deduction(premises=[aristotle], conclusion=composite_slower,
    reason="If heavier = faster, then the light stone must slow down the heavy one.")
deduction(premises=[aristotle], conclusion=composite_faster,
    reason="If heavier = faster, then the heavier composite must fall faster.")

paradox = contradiction(composite_slower, composite_faster,
    reason="Same premise yields opposite conclusions")

galileo_argument = deduction(
    premises=[paradox, heavy_faster],
    conclusion=vacuum_law,
    reason="Contradiction in Aristotle's doctrine forces a new law",
)
```

`src/galileo_falling_bodies/__init__.py` — re-export all declarations:

```python
from .knowledge import aristotle, heavy_faster, composite_slower, composite_faster, vacuum_law
from .reasoning import paradox, galileo_argument

__all__ = [
    "aristotle", "heavy_faster", "composite_slower",
    "composite_faster", "vacuum_law",
    "paradox", "galileo_argument",
]
```

**3. Compile and validate**

```bash
gaia compile .
gaia check .
```

**4. Write a review sidecar** to assign priors and strategy parameters for inference.

Reviews live in `src/galileo_falling_bodies/reviews/`. Each review is a Python file exporting a `REVIEW` bundle — different reviewers can assign different priors to the same knowledge.

`src/galileo_falling_bodies/reviews/self_review.py`:

```python
from gaia.review import ReviewBundle, review_claim, review_strategy
from .. import aristotle, heavy_faster, composite_slower, composite_faster, vacuum_law, galileo_argument

REVIEW = ReviewBundle(
    source_id="self_review",
    objects=[
        review_claim(aristotle, prior=0.9,
            judgment="supporting",
            justification="Widely accepted for 2000 years, matches everyday experience."),
        review_claim(heavy_faster, prior=0.8,
            judgment="supporting",
            justification="Well-documented observation in air."),
        review_claim(composite_slower, prior=0.6,
            judgment="tentative",
            justification="Plausible under Aristotelian framework."),
        review_claim(composite_faster, prior=0.6,
            judgment="tentative",
            justification="Also plausible under Aristotelian framework."),
        review_claim(vacuum_law, prior=0.3,
            judgment="tentative",
            justification="Not yet established — the argument should raise this."),
        review_strategy(galileo_argument,
            judgment="formalized",
            justification="Classic reductio ad absurdum."),
    ],
)
```

**5. Run belief propagation**

```bash
gaia infer .
```

The engine compiles the IR into a factor graph, automatically selects the best algorithm (exact junction tree for small graphs, loopy BP for larger ones), and writes results to `.gaia/reviews/self_review/`:

```
Inferred 6 beliefs from 4 priors and 0 strategy parameter records
Method: JT (exact), 2ms
Review: self_review
Output: .gaia/reviews/self_review/beliefs.json
```

`beliefs.json` contains the posterior probability for each claim after propagation:

| Claim | Prior | → | Posterior | |
|-------|------:|---|----------:|---|
| `aristotle` | 0.90 | → | **0.02** | ⬇️ contradiction propagates back — Aristotle refuted |
| `vacuum_law` | 0.30 | → | **0.68** | ⬆️ deduction from the contradiction raises belief |
| `heavy_faster` | 0.80 | → | **0.55** | ⬇️ pulled down by the deduction chain |
| `composite_slower` | 0.60 | → | **0.39** | ⬇️ contradiction forces mutual exclusion |
| `composite_faster` | 0.60 | → | **0.39** | ⬇️ symmetric with `composite_slower` |

If multiple reviews exist, specify which one: `gaia infer --review self_review .`

**6. Generate README**

```bash
gaia compile . --readme
```

Generates a `README.md` at the package root with:
- Overview Mermaid graph of exported conclusions (with belief values)
- Full knowledge graph diagram (all nodes, strategies, operators)
- Each knowledge node with content, prior, belief, derivation, and reasoning
- Inference results summary table

Run `gaia infer .` first so the README includes up-to-date belief values.

**7. Publish**

```bash
git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin main --tags
gaia register . --registry-dir ../gaia-registry --create-pr
```

## Install a Package

Add a registered Gaia knowledge package as a dependency:

```bash
gaia add galileo-falling-bodies-gaia
```

This queries the [Gaia Official Registry](https://github.com/SiliconEinstein/gaia-registry)
for the package metadata, resolves the latest version, and calls `uv add` with
a pinned git URL. Use `--version` to pin a specific version:

```bash
gaia add galileo-falling-bodies-gaia --version 1.0.0
```

## Claude Code Plugin

Gaia provides a [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) plugin with a **formalization** skill that guides you through converting any knowledge source (scientific papers, textbooks, technical reports) into a Gaia knowledge package.

**Install:**

```bash
# In Claude Code, add the Gaia marketplace
/plugin marketplace add SiliconEinstein/Gaia

# Install the formalization plugin
/plugin install formalization
```

**Use:**

```bash
# Start formalizing a source
/formalization
```

The skill walks you through a four-pass process: extract knowledge nodes, connect reasoning strategies, check completeness, and refine strategy types. It also covers review sidecar authoring and BP result interpretation.
